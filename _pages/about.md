I am a Web Developer who previously worked for clients from various industries. The tools I used in development were HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, Wordpress, AngularJS, Laravel, and Foundation Framework. 

I am currently looking for a new opportunity where I can put my skills to use, to meet people of the same interests, and to learn new things.
