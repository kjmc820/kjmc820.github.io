I'm a Web Developer. Previously, I worked alongside a small team in Valenzuela in creating web sites and apps for various clients. My aim was to developed sites and apps that would represent our client's personality, message, and mission. The tools I have used in development was HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, AngularJS, Laravel, and Foundation Framework.

I am currently looking for a new opportunity where I can put my skills to use, to meet people of same interests, and to learn new things.
